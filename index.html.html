	<h2>ABOUT NARUTO UZUMAKI</h2>
	<p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts â€“ the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>

	<h2> Why naruto is every one's favorite:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>He always like to help others.</li>
		<li> He always care about his friend. </li>
		<li> He has a lot of friend .</li>
		<li>It's not quite as sprawling as laughably long animated series like One Piece, but jumping into the world of Naruto at this point is still quite a daunting task.</li>
	</ol>
	<!--FRIEND-->
	<h2>Narutos friends:</h2>
